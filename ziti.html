<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package dry ziti pasta</li>
        <li>1 pound mild Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 ½ jars spaghetti sauce, divided</li>
        <li>1 package shredded Italian cheese blend</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li></p>
        <p><li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. 
            Once the water is boiling, stir in the ziti, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta 
            uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still 
            firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.</li></p>
        <p><li>While pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage, 
            and cook and stir until brown, about 10 minutes. Drain sausage and set aside.</li></p>
        <p><li>Stir together the ricotta, egg, onion, garlic, and oregano in a large bowl until 
            well combined. Stir in the drained pasta, the drained sausage, salt, pepper, 
            and 1/2 jar of the spaghetti sauce; mix well.</li></p>
        <p><li>In the prepared baking dish, cover the bottom with 1/3 jar of spaghetti sauce. 
            Layer 1/2 of the pasta mixture, 1/3 jar of spaghetti sauce, and 1/2 of the 
            shredded cheese. Then layer the remaining 1/2 of the pasta, 1/3 of the sauce, 
            and 1/2 of the cheese. Sprinkle with basil. Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil.</li></p>
        <p><li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 20 minutes. Uncover; 
            return to the oven and bake until cheese is melted, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li></p>
